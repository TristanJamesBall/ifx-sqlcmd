README file for SQLCMD Version 90.02 (2016-07-28)

===========================================================================

The SQLCMD suite of tools provides a number of programs for manipulating
Informix databases.

The primary download site is the International Informix User's Group
Software Archive (http://www.iiug.org/software); membership is required
but it is free.

What is SQLCMD?
===============

SQLCMD is an SQL Command Interpreter for Informix databases.  It is
analogous to the Query-Language option of DB-Access or ISQL, but it is
designed to work better in shell scripts.  It has a number of features
not available in DB-Access.  The only advantage DB-Access has over
SQLCMD is the screen-mode (curses-based) interface.  On the other hand,
one of SQLCMD's principal advantages is precisely that it is not
constrained by a curses-based interface.

SQLCMD is written in ESQL/C.  It works with (or is supposed to work
with) any version of ESQL/C from 5.00 (circa 1990) upwards.  You will
need a copy of ESQL/C (probably as part of Client SDK or CSDK) on the
machine where you build SQLCMD, and you will need either ESQL/C (meaning
CSDK) or I-Connect on the machine where it is run.

You should be able to obtain CSDK from either IBM or the IIUG:
* http://www.ibm.com/software/data/informix
* http://www.iiug.org

SQLCMD has a history mechanism that allows you to review, edit and rerun
commands you ran previously.

SQLCMD will use the GNU readline library if it is installed on your
machine.  This allows you to edit the command you are typing, or to find
commands you ran previously and rerun them, possibly after editing them.

===========================================================================

This version also provides a prototype version of SQLUPLOAD, which is used
to insert or update data depending on whether there is a record to update
or not.  See the manual page (sqlupload.1) for more information.  Note that
as a prototype, it can have stray diagnostics, not every documented
feature necessarily works, and there could be bugs in it.  Please report
bugs or questionable behaviour.

You also get some other more or less useful programs, including:
    * updblob  -- update blob from file
    * mkproc   -- execute SQL statements with CREATE PROCEDURE FROM
    * histdump -- print SQL commands recorded in SQLCMD history file

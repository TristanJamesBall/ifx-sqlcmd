Testing SQLCMD
==============

SQLCMD Test Tools (STT)

Objectives
----------

1.  The test suite should emulate the Perl test suite for quietness.
2.  Each test script should be self-contained.
3.  Each test script should define expected output and should compare
    the actual output with the expected output.
4.  Each test should unambiguously pass or fail.
5.  Many environment variables need to be controlled carefully.
    *   SQLCMDLOG
    *   DBDATE
    *   PATH
6.  There must be a 'clean' target to remove test debris.
7.  Objective 1 probably means that MAKE will not be used to run the
    tests in the long run -- GNU Make is very verbose when multiple
    directories are involved.  Or we'll actually use the .SILENT
    directive for the first time ever!
8.  Use stt_test to run component tests - it handles most of the work
    cleanly.  It certainly made a huge difference to the existing tests
    when it was applied to, say, t04lvarchar.sh.  Actually, it made the
    difference between "this whole testing scheme stinks - that's a
    technical term" and "this test infrastructure may not be perfect,
    but at least gives a reasonable set of results for systematically
    written tests".

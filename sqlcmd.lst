#   @(#)SQLCMD Version 90.02 (2016-07-28)
#   @(#)Definitive list of files -- Installed Software
#
#   -- The installed file column contains the name of the file to be
#      installed.  The name is quoted relative to the base directory.
#      The name could also be prefixed with an environment variable
#      which would be set by the installation script.
#
#   -- The type of file indicates what sort of file is to be installed.
#   -- The type "file" means an ordinary file.
#   -- The type "directory" means that the file is the name of a
#      directory which must exist when the software is installed.
#      The installation program will create the directory
#      if it does not already exist.  The directory entry must come before
#      the first file entry which lives in the directory.
#   -- The type "deleted" means that this file used to exist in a previous
#      release of the software and is no longer relevant.  The file will
#      be removed from the installed system.  It can also be used to clean
#      up after the installation process.
#   -- The type "link" means that the installed file is a link to a file
#      already installed.  The name in the Link column is the name of the
#      file which the file is to be linked to.
#      This file must already exist.  
#   -- The type "symlink" means that the installed file is a link to a file
#      already installed.  The name in the Link column is the name of the
#      file which the file is to be linked to.
#   -- The type "exec" means that the installed file is executed.  If the
#      link field is not '-', then it is passed to the program as its sole
#      argument.  The configuration file (sqlcmd.ins) should have set any
#      extra environment variables needed.  Note that the installed file
#      must be executable.
#   -- The type "config" means that the file will be configure by the
#      script specified in the 'link' field.  Intended use: configuring
#      shell script for installation in $HOME/bin that refers to
#      software installed somewhere else without requiring the user to
#      add a new directory to their path.
#   -- The types "mapfile", "maplink", and "mapsym" mean that the file
#      and link names may optionally be mapped with a suffix provided by
#      the user.  The intended use is to permit a .32 or .64 suffix to
#      be added to executables that may be multiply installed with
#      32-bit or 64-bit versions.
#   -- The type "condfile" means that the file should be installed if
#      present but it is not an error if it is absent.  Otherwise, the
#      same as a file.
#
#   -- Permissions are the file permissions to be set on the file.
#      The three subfields are owner, group, mode.
#      The owner - is used to indicate the default owner for the file.
#      The group - is used to indicate the default group for the file.
#      Other owner/group values are treated as literal values.  The
#      default owner and group are the current user and group (the one
#      running the install), but that can be overridden on the command
#      line.  Other user or group names should be known to exist; the
#      sqlcmd.ins file can check this.
#
#   -- Comment lines start with a hash (#)
#   -- Blank lines are ignored
#   -- Tabs are non-preferred characters

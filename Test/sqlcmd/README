	-- headings on
	-- types on
	-- data types
3. LOAD and UNLOAD commands
	-- all formats
	-- different TX sizes
	-- load errors
4. Context commands

Testing Command Reading:

1.	JL 2000-07-09: When reading from keyboard.
2.	JL 2000-07-09: When reading from file.
3.	JL 2000-07-09: When reading from /dev/tty input within a file.

4.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for initial comments.
5.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for blank lines in between commands.
6.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for blank lines within commands.
7.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for empty files, and files with no useful content.
8.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for no prompt during file input.
9.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for prompts during keyboard input.

10.	JL 2000-07-09: Use echo for much of the testing.
11.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for quote matching.
12.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for semicolons in comments and strings.
13.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for quotes in comments.
14.	JL 2000-07-09: Test for trace on and trace off from file.

Testing Command Line Options:

15. JL 2000-08-01: Test for mutually exclusive options -C, -P, -R, -U.
16. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLRELOAD -C operates as SQLCMD.
17. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLRELOAD -U operates as SQLUNLOAD.
18. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLRELOAD -R operates as SQLRELOAD.
19. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLUNLOAD -C operates as SQLCMD.
20. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLUNLOAD -U operates as SQLUNLOAD.
21. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLUNLOAD -R operates as SQLRELOAD.
22. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLCMD -C operates as SQLCMD.
23. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLCMD -U operates as SQLUNLOAD.
24. JL 2000-08-01: Test that SQLCMD -R operates as SQLRELOAD.
25. JL 2000-08-01: Test that -P option generates unimplemented message.

Testing scripts:

t01version.sh:
    Print out version information, primarily for documentation purposes.

t01mutexopt.sh:
    Test the handling of mutually exclusive options

t02varchar.sh:
    Test that the handling of VARCHAR data is not causing overwrites.

t03iofiles.sh:
    *INCOMPLETE* Test the handling of input and output files.

t04boolean.sh:
    Create table with serial and boolean column
    Load 3 valid false values, 3 valid true values, 1 null value
    Use UNLOAD format to unload
    Use explicit LOAD statement
    Use RELOAD operation from command line

t05lvarchar.sh:
    Create table with serial and lvarchar column
    Load 3 valid values, 1 null value
    Use UNLOAD format to unload
    Use explicit LOAD statement
    Use RELOAD operation from command line

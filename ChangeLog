=============================

@(#)$Id: ChangeLog,v 2016.1 2016/07/28 19:53:09 jleffler Exp $

Version 90.02
-------------
2016-07-28: Version 90.02 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2016-07-28: Generate error message instead of assertion failure if argument
            to -D, -E, -G, -Q is (massively) too long.  Issue raised by Art
            Kagel <art.kagel@gmail.com> on behalf of Adam Tauno Williams
            <awilliam@whitemiceconsulting.com> with problem probably caused
            by quote handling in myexport.sh.  The grammar files
            (connecty.y, connect.h) already limit these in LOAD, RELOAD and
            UNLOAD statements.

Version 90.01
-------------
2015-11-14: Version 90.01 - Limited release.
2015-11-14: Explicitly set IFX_DEFERRED_PREPARE=0 in environment to avoid
            problems when it is set to 1.  SQLCMD expects PREPARE to tell
            it what type of statement it is processing and gets upset if
            that information is deferred.  Problem reported by Eric Byrnes
            <eric.byrnes@bldr.com>.
2015-11-14: Arrange to suppress #pragma GCC lines that can cause problems
            with GCC 4.5.x and earlier.  They are primarily to reassure the
            maintainer that the code is clean and don't really affect end
            users (unless the default compilation options are made much
            more stringent).  Problem reported in October by Ray Burns
            <Ray.Burns@velocityglobal.co.nz>.

Version 90.00
-------------
2015-11-08: Version 90.00 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2015-07-17: Move documentation to share/man/man1 (instead of man/man1).
2015-07-16: Add support for 'block' output format (e.g. sqlcmd -F block).
            Closely based on a patch provided by Øyvind Gjerstad
            <oyvind.gjerstad@postnord.com>.  Simulates DB-Access output
            format, with each row printed with the column name on the left
            and the value on the right.

Version 89.03
-------------
2015-07-10: Version 89.03 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2015-07-10: Warn when -u or -p options appear after -d on command line.
2015-07-10: Sundry cleanup operations (posixver.h, etc).
2015-07-10: Ensure correct handling of WHERE in connblob.ec

Version 89.02
-------------
2014-07-27: Version 89.02.
2014-07-27: Report when exit status from system() is non-zero, avoiding
            compilation warning on Ubuntu 14.04.

Version 89.01
-------------
2013-12-28: Version 89.01.
2013-12-28: Fix selblob code (broken, unspotted, since May 2008; reported
            by Chris Wolf <Chris.Wolf@sungardps.com>).  Rudimentary test
            for selblob.  Option handling changes in selblob, appblob,
            selmultiblob. Fix independent build for selmultiblob.

Version 89.00
-------------
2013-09-08: Version 89.00 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2013-09-08: Fix compilation warnings under stringent compilation options,
            reported by Øyvind Gjerstad <ogj@tollpost.no>.
2013-09-08: Fix compilation warnings from GNU Readline under very stringent
            compilation options, introducing gnureadline.h to centralize
            the hackery.

Version 88.02
-------------
2012-10-28: Version 88.02 - Limited distribution.
2012-10-28: Fix serious malformatting of characters needing escapes
            (reported by Dirk Bornhütter <dirk@bornhuetter.de> via Art
            Kagel).
2012-08-14: Redo sleep command to avoid C99 interleaved declarations and
            statements.  Reported by Art Kagel <art.kagel@gmail.com> on
            behalf of a client using AIX 5.2.  It is not clear whether
            configure.ac is using AC_PROG_CC_C99 correctly.

Version 88.01
-------------
2012-08-05: Version 88.01 - Never formally released to anybody.
2012-08-05: Add omitted keywords to keyword rule in connecty.y.

Version 88.00
-------------
2012-07-20: Version 88.00 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2012-07-19: Finish support for -b (DB-Access -X).  In DB-Access, SELECT
            and OUTPUT are not affected by -X; in SQLCMD, SELECT is.
2012-06-21: Support fractional seconds in sleep.  If the system supports
            usleep() but not nanosleep() or clock_nanosleep(), then any
            sleep requested that is longer than 1000 seconds is converted
            to a plain sleep() call with no sub-second component.
2011-11-02: Add '-b' to support DB-Access hex (-X) mode input and output,
            as requested by Kernoal Stephens <kernoals@gmail.com>.
2011-09-02: Build: MacOS X Lion (10.7) needs ranlib on updated libraries.
2011-09-02: Configure for memmem() - MacOS X Lion (10.7) has it too.
2011-05-12: Improve formatting of column names and types; responds to the
            different format options.  Fixed widths should be the same for
            headings, types and data (needs major data structure changes).

Version 87.02
-------------
2010-12-18: Version 87.02 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2010-12-18: Add support for connections establishing trusted contexts.

Version 87.01
-------------
2010-12-06: Version 87.01 - Limited distribution.
2010-12-06: Dusan Simic <dusan.simic@versaterm.com> reports compiling 86.00
            and 87.00 on AIX 6.1; related to memmem() and C99; fixed.

Version 87.00
-------------
2010-10-21: Version 87.00 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2010-10-21: Fix bug found by Eric Haszlakiewicz <ehaszla@transunion.com> in
            UNLOAD with delimiter, and related bugs that are now obvious.
2010-10-13: Introduce -G eor to set EOR on command line.  Fix escaping so
            if EOR is (say) '\f', newlines in data are not escaped.  For
            multi-character EOR (such as CRLF), escape first character (CR)
            but not second (LF) or subsequent (but is that correct, or
            should all characters in EOR string be escaped?).  Also, do we
            check for overlap of EOR with delimiter and escape?  Add
            $DBNEWLINE as environment variable parallel to DBDELIMITER,
            DBESCAPE, DBQUOTE.
2010-09-25: Reinstate stderr.[ch] v8.x technology as v10.x
2010-09-25: Patch from Øyvind Gjerstad <ogj@tollpost.no> to fix bug in
            HTML output.

-------------
2010-09-10: Version 86.09 - Uploaded to IIUG.
2010-09-10: People actively running into the POSIX getline() problem.
2010-05-26: Various changes in preparation for things to come (in 87.xx).

Version 86.08
-------------
2010-05-16: Version 86.08 - internal release only.
2010-05-16: Rename getline() to jlss_getline() to avoid conflict with POSIX
            2008 version of getline(), found in <stdio.h> in recent Linux.
2010-05-16: Configure now uses ./program to test ESQL/C for dot-less PATH.

Version 86.07
-------------
2010-04-11: Version 86.07 - internal release only.
2010-04-11: Redo ifx_var_dealloc() fix - GCC 3.4.5 on Linux not happy.

-------------
2010-04-11: Version 86.06 - internal release only.
2010-04-11: Fix argument handling (remove -G, -W support; do not list -n).
2010-01-06: Richard Fahey <RFahey@west.com> reported a core dump in
            sqlupload.  Reproduces on MacOS X - crash was in
            ifx_var_dealloc() in describe.ec.  The problem can be seen
            when looking at the ifx_var_flag() code, and then comparing
            it with the ifx_var_dealloc().

Version 86.05
-------------
2009-10-22: Version 86.05 - limited externl release.
2009-10-22: Make C99 code work under C89 too (problems found with ancient
            AIX C compilers (XLC v6) by Joe Plugge <JRPlugge@west.com>).
2009-07-17: Add support for CSDK versions to 4.99 (Panther uses 4.10).

2008-11-03: Edit sqlcmd.1 to clarify support for basic IUS types (BOOLEAN,
            LVARCHAR, INT8, BIGINT, SERIAL8, BIGSERIAL) prompted by a question
            from Joe R Plugge <JRPlugge@west.com>.
2008-10-21: Fix connecty.y so it can work as a test program (again).
2008-09-19: AutoConf 2.63 marks AC_TYPE_SIGNAL as obsolescent (can safely
            assume RETSIGTYPE is void everywhere).  Remove use of both
            macro and type.
2008-08-17: SQLCMD: Detect program name better (sqlreload.64 == sqlreload).
2008-08-15: Configure now checks that ESQL/C compiler 'works'.
2008-08-01: Update version information - per "Software Craftsmanship" by
            Pete McBreen.

-------------
2008-07-15: Version 86.00 - released to IIUG Software Archive.
2008-07-15: SQLCMD: Include test suite now that it has been upgraded to be
            manageable; run with 'make test'.  Include a SCHEDULE file from
            1992, just for curiosity - shows what testing should be in
            place but isn't.
2008-07-13: SQLCMD: describe.ec v2007.1 (2007-02-10) broke loading of
            LVARCHAR, so afflicts 81.00 onwards.  Workaround coded, but
            long-term solution probably involves rather dramatic changes.
2008-07-12: SQLCMD: revise code to recognize dbase@server:owner.table
            in LOAD statements, including DELIMIDENT support.  Also minor
            fix ups in test suite.

Version 84.03
-------------
2008-04-06: Version 84.03 - limited release only.
2008-04-06: Second attempt: explicitly test for uintptr_t and PRIXPTR.
            Previous 'solution' worked for 64-bit ESQL/C on Solaris 9, but

2005-06-21: HISTDUMP: revise history mechanism to open history files in
            read only mode when requested, adding parameter to hist_open().

Version 78.00
-------------
2005-05-06: Version 78.00 uploaded to IIUG.
2005-05-06: SQLCMD: Add support for 'fixsep' format - fixed format output
            with field separators (current field delimiter).
2005-05-06: SQLCMD: The '@' prefix to commands is officially deprecated,
            and support will be removed after 2006-06-30.
2005-05-06: SQLCMD: Try to permit unquoted file names in LOAD, UNLOAD and
            RELOAD.  It is not readily doable - this deviation from the
            Informix tools is now formally documented.
2005-05-03: SQLCMD: Add 'help' built-in command.  Need to sort out I18N.
2005-04-29: SQLCMD: Add '-X record=rectag,recset=settag,header=hdrtag'
            support, using getsubopt().  Deprecate '-G rectag' - it still
            works but is redundant; support for it will be dropped after
            2006-06-30.  Revise 'format xml' to accept the new notation.

Version 77.08
-------------
2005-04-22: Version 77.08 uploaded to IIUG.
2005-04-22: SQLCMD: Fix XML output heading - bug reported by Roy Mercer
            <roy.mercer@gmail.com>.  Output now accepted by Firefox 1.0.3
            as XML, albeit without any style information.  Remove the
            dubious encoding information.  Convert the heading XML tags to
            lower case.

Version 77.07
-------------
2005-04-01: Version 77.07 uploaded to IIUG.
2005-04-01: LIBRARY: make sure tokencmp.h has size_t so it compiles on
            HP-UX; found by Randy Kennedy <rkennedy@scottsdaleaz.gov>.
2005-04-01: SQLCMD: Change of mind; -N 0 will not be supported.  Use a
            number bigger than the number of rows in your data file.  Do
            not try to load more than 2 billion rows in a single TX.

Version 77.06
-------------
2005-03-31: Version 77.06 on limited release.
2005-03-31: SQLCMD: CSV output follows Excel and uses doubled up quotes
            rather than backslash quote.  Document -G in extended help.
            Fix the counting during RELOAD.
2005-03-30: SQLCMD: Support SKIP n in LOAD and RELOAD (-S n on command
            line).  Permit -N 0 to suppress sub-transactions in RELOAD.

Version 77.05
-------------
2005-03-25: Version 77.05 released to IIUG.
2005-03-25: SQLCMD: Fix loading problems with CSV data containing commas
            or quotes in strings, after a question raised by
            <try_and_err@web.de> in comp.databases.informix on
            2005-03-17.  Rework the internals of readload.c with
            separate CSV field scanning logic - based on the code from
            Kernighan & Pike 'The Practice of Programming' (see
            http://tpop.awl.com/).

Version 77.04
-------------
2005-03-18: Version 77.04 released.
2005-03-18: SQLCMD: Fix problems reading commands with backslashes in
            strings.  Fix problems reading load files where the last
            character of the last field is a backslash.

Version 77.03
-------------
2005-03-01: Version 77.03 released to IIUG.
2005-02-28: SQLCMD: Add format option to LOAD and RELOAD, and add format
            and recordtag options to UNLOAD.  Fix misalignment of array
            in context.c with enum in context.h (core dump).
2005-02-25: SQLCMD: Add '-Y' option for no history in interactive mode.
2005-02-25: Revise code in sqlconn.ec to avoid static buffer.

Version 77.02
-------------

2005-02-23: BLOB TOOLS: Upgraded to use SQLCMDPASSWORDS too.

Version 77.01
-------------
2005-01-12: Version 77.01 released.
2005-01-12: BUILD: upgrade to work using C++ compiler.
2005-01-12: SQLCMD: remove dependence on mktemp() in internal.c
2005-01-11: SQLCMD: Do not report long tokens as a problem in general.

Version 77.00
-------------
2005-01-04: Version 77.00 released.
2005-01-03: SQLCMD: Support SQLCMDPASSWORDS environment variable,
            analogous to INFOTPASS in infotables program, which is
            available at the IIUG and was written by Ravikrishna
            (rkusenet@sympatico.ca), after prodding.  The semantics are
            slightly different - if you specify "sqlcmd -u me -d mine",
            SQLCMD will ignore the entry 'mine|you|yours' because it is
            for the wrong user (but AFAICT infotables would use that
            entry, connecting as 'you').
2004-12-25: Various refactorizations of headers to permit development of
            'adhoc' on machines without CSDK.
2004-12-08: SQLUNLOAD: Add -O orderby option.
2004-12-03: Revise FAQ.html to discuss 64-bit builds on Solaris, and
            indirectly on other non-natively 64-bit platforms.  Issue
            raised by Jinming Xiao <jxiao@us.ibm.com> on attempting to
            compile SQLCMD with a 64-bit platform.

Version 76.00
-------------
2004-10-15: Version 76.00 released.
2004-10-14: Pablo León <pablo.leon@horus.es> added '-u username -p
            password' support to the *blob programs -- thanks, Pablo.

Version 75.00
-------------
2004-08-25: Version 75.00 released.
2004-08-24: CONFIGURE: Accommodate CSDK 2.90 which contains ESQL/C 2.90,
            not 9.54 as you would expect.  Most source code should not test
            ESQLC_VERSION; only headers such as esqlc.h may use it.
2004-08-17: SQLCMD: LOAD handles DB-Access style backslash-space data for
            empty, non-null VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, LVARCHAR fields.  Found bug
            B169213 (ifx_var_setdata() does not permit zero-length values);
            workaround in place.  Also found B169309 (insert cursors do not
            handle zero-length non-null VARCHAR<->NVARCHAR conversions
            properly); no workaround devised yet (known BUG in SQLCMD).
2004-08-04: SQLCMD: UNLOAD generates DB-Access style backslash-space output
            for empty, non-null VARCHAR, NVARCHAR and LVARCHAR values.
            (Requested by Ravi <rkusenet@sympatico.ca>; previously known
            defect - for compatibility with DB-Access.)
2004-06-29: SQLCMD: Do not silently ignore history commands when history
            turned off.

Version 74.03
-------------
2004-06-07: Version 74.03 released.
2004-06-07: ADMIN: Correct attribution in v74.02.

Version 74.00
-------------
2004-06-01: Version 74.00 released.
2004-06-01: SQLCMD: Refix RELOAD and LOAD statement handling.
2004-05-28: SQLCMD: Do not append ASCII NUL '\0' to TEXT blobs on LOAD.
2004-05-28: Library: Recognize SET/*x*/{ as IUS token.
2004-04-23: SQLCMD: Recognize CREATE FUNCTION or PROCEDURE with EXTERNAL
            NAME (END FUNCTION or PROCEDURE is optional).

Version 73.00
-------------
2004-01-15: Version 73.00 released.
2004-01-14: SQLCMD: Finish work on verbose mode (pro tem) and report
            B165572 against sqlstype.h.

Version 72.08
-------------
2004-01-13: Version 72.08 released with minimal circulation.
2004-01-13: SQLCMD: Fix code to detect use of readline library in sqlver.c.
2004-01-13: SQLCMD: Support /* C style comments */ in SQL since IDS 7.31,
            9.30, 9.40 all do so (and have done since 1997).

Version 72.07
-------------
2003-12-18: Version 72.07 released.
2003-12-18: SQLCMD: Fix incorrect order of code and declarations for C89;
            reported by Mark Esser <esserm@us.ibm.com>.

Version 72.06
-------------
2003-12-01: Version 72.06 released.
2003-12-01: SQLCMD: Under -H or -T options, XML output now includes a
            heading section which describes each column.  Requested by Paul
            Falbe <falbe@cassens.com>.  EOR used consistently to end
            records in XML format too.
2003-12-01: SQLCMD: Finish removing err_error[12] and err_remark[12] calls,
            and related cleanup work (most work done prior to today).
2003-11-18: SQLCMD: Remove reference to l_sysid in filelock.c (only found
            on Solaris?).  Problem found by Paul Falbe <falbe@cassens.com>
            on HP-UX 11.

Version 72.05
-------------
2003-09-05: Version 72.05 released.
2003-09-05: SQLCMD: Add -G xmltag command line option.  Remove petty
            restrictions on -T, -H, -N and -F options.

Version 72.04
-------------
2003-06-25: Version 72.04 released.
2003-06-25: AUTOCONF: handle case where esql compiler not on PATH.
2003-06-23: Minor reformatting of many files; update dependencies.
2003-06-23: SQLCMD: fix complaint about invalid opening quote for CSV
            output "-F csv"; reported by Art Kagel <kagel@bloomberg.net>.
2003-06-03: SQLCMD: increase size of command buffer in internal.c.  Fix
            buffer overwrite bug and improper detection of EOF when END
            PROCEDURE does not appear before command buffer overflows.

Version 72.03
-------------
2003-04-22: Version 72.03 released - given limited circulation.
2003-04-22: SQLCMD: add history locking etc to deal with concurrent use.
2003-04-16: AUTOCONF: Add large file support (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE).
2003-04-15: SQLCMD: allow blanks in quoted file names.
2003-04-15: SQLCMD: revise code to create CONNECT (or DATABASE) statement
            from command line options and then execute using do_command()
            for timing etc.
2003-04-09: Updated manual page to mention EOR command and fix up
            documentation of output command (thanks to Ron MacNeil
            <RMacNeil@cumpugen.com> for highlighting the problem).

Version 72.02
-------------
2003-04-08: Version 72.02 released - given limited circulation.
2003-04-08: Fix botched version control on 72.01 (no update of NMD).

Version 72.01
-------------
2003-04-07: Version 72.01 released - given limited circulation.
2003-04-07: Add semi-tested support for BOOLEAN and LVARCHAR data types,
            at instigation of Ravi Krishna <rkrishna@farelogix.com>.
2003-04-07: Add semi-tested support for INT8 and SERIAL8 following
            suggestion from Zoran Naskov <maskovz@yahoo.com>.

Version 72.00
-------------
2003-04-02: Version 72.00 released to IIUG.
2003-04-02: Formally state in README file etc that software is released
            under GNU General Public Licence version 2, but people can
            contact the author for alternatives if those conditions are too
            onerous.  Include GPL in distribution as LICENCE file.
2003-03-31: MKPROC: fix error handling to ignore SQLNOTFOUND, per dicussion
            on c.d.i with subject "Batch updates with ESQL" started by
            Roger Aunebakk <aunebakk@hotmail.com> on 2003-03-26.  Note that
            bug B162088 was also entered into PTS as a result of this.

Version 71.04
-------------
2003-03-12: Version 71.04 limited release.
2003-03-12: Fix problem with using int2 in insblob.ec after bug report from
            Art Kagel <kagel@bloomberg.net>.
2003-03-12: Fix bugs in new history mechanism, and improve error reporting.

Version 71.03
-------------
2003-03-07: Version 71.03 release planned but not executed.
2003-03-06: Upgrade history mechanism to use architecture-neutral file
            format (partly suggestion by Art Kagel <kagel@bloomberg.net>).
            Changes magic number.  History files should be interchangeable
            between 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
2003-03-04: Remove #define _XOPEN_SOURCE from upload.ec because it caused
            problems on Solaris 7 for Intel and was only added to get hold
            of strdup(), which is not used any more anyway (reported by Tom
            Smith <Tom_Smith@ao.uscourts.gov>).
2002-11-05: Overwrite password information on 'command line'.  Does nothing
            useful on Solaris 7, but might reduce the chance of a user
            snooping a password via the 'ps' command on some systems (or,
            there again, it might not).

Version 71.02
-------------
2002-10-11: Version 71.02 released (sent to WAIUG and IIUG).
2002-10-11: ADMIN: renamed README as INSTALL and created new README after
            tip from Walt Hultgren <walt@iiug.org>.  Minor updates to
            FAQ.html, etc.

Version 71.01
-------------
2002-10-10: Version 71.01 released (sent to WAIUG and IIUG).
2002-10-10: CONFIGURE: Some issues found on Solaris with configure script
            generated by autoconf 2.53 on MacOS X.  Upgraded configure.in
            to try and accommodate both, but regenerated configure on
            Solaris with autoconf 2.13.

Version 71
----------
2002-10-10: Version 71 released.
2002-10-09: ClientSDK 2.80 produces a very different version string for
            'esql -V' which needs different code in acinformix.m4 to detect
            both old and new with a single regular expression.

Version 70
----------
2002-08-15: Version 70 released.
2002-07-15: Minor disaster - hard disk crash on master source machine
            shortly after moving house.  Most changes recovered, including
            non-committed ones.  All releases will now have both MSD and
            NMD variants archived and dispatched to multiple machines.

Version 69.02
-------------
2002-05-30: Version 69.02 created.
2002-05-30: SQLCMD: Handle maximum length delimited identifiers.

Version 69.01
-------------
2002-02-08: Version 69.01 created.
2002-02-08: SQLCMD: Fix bug mishandling y-umlaut (0xFF) in data file.
2002-02-08: SQLCMD: Fix bug handling delimiter string in load/unload.
2002-01-11: SQLCMD: Re-revert to do_command() - probably a debugging change
            that was not reversed when debugging complete.  Should probably
            provide a programmatic mechanism to switch between two modes.

Version 69
----------
2002-01-02: Version 69 released.
2002-01-01: SQLCMD: Add basic support for UNLOAD TO [FILE|PIPE] and LOAD
            FROM [FILE|PIPE].  Note that if SIGPIPE is received, SQLCMD
            terminates, which is not acceptable in the medium term.

Version 68
----------
2001-11-19: Version 68 released.
2001-11-16: SQLCMD: Fix handling of SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED (missing
            two symbols from definition of keyword in grammar).

Version 67
----------
2001-11-01: Version 67 released.
2001-10-19: SQLCMD: Fix grammar so SET DEBUG FILE TO "/tmp/dbg.out"; works.
2001-10-11: SQLCMD: Remove the old '*not yet*' comments from INFO HELP.
2001-10-11: SQLCMD: Add ERRMSG command like ECHO but writes to error file.
2001-10-11: SQLCMD: Revert to using sql_command() to executing INFO
            commands, but parameterize this by using a pointer to function
            rather than either sql_command() or do_command() directly.
            Implication: do_command() provides benchmark, trace and history
            services; sql_command() does not.
2001-10-10: SQLCMD: Include the table number and the number of rows in the
            table in INFO STATUS output.
2001-10-10: SQLCMD: Update output.c to use new dec_sci(), dec_fix() code.
2001-10-10: SQLCMD: SQLSTATE was not available in 5.x ESQL/C.  Test using
            ESQLC_VERSION number rather than an ESQL/C feature test.

Version 66
----------
2001-10-01: Version 66 released.
2001-10-01: SQLCMD: Fix core dump and other context problems handling XML
            record tag.  Fix uninitialized benchmark status stack.  Make
            use of STRDUP macro consistent - return value is not checked.
2001-09-30: Add SELMULTIBLOB example blob manipulation program.
2001-09-30: SQLCMD: Add new grammar.h, grammar.y to distribution, even
            though they are currently unused.  They provide an indication
            of what will happen to LOAD, UNLOAD, RELOAD and UPLOAD, but
            nothing is carved in stone as yet.  Note that one probable
            option is to add the SQLCMD built-in commands to the grammar
            too -- providing a level of checking (and options) that are not
            currently available.  For example: "output to /tmp/x3" writes
            to a file called "to", rather than generating an error.
2001-09-29: SQLCMD: Use new library functions to convert C character/string
            literals to corresponding characters - for EOR, Quote, Escape,
            Delimiter.  Use quotify() in sqlcmd.c to allow sloppy command
            line arguments.
2001-09-09: SQLCMD: Add code to handle EOR delimiters.  Fix bug such that
            "delim;" did not print delimiter and did set delimiter to
            semi-colon.  Broken backwards compatibility: character for
            quote, escape, delim commands must be in quotes.
2001-09-09: Add SELBLOB and APPBLOB example blob manipulation programs.
2001-09-04: SQLCMD: Separate structure for CONNECT from INFO from LOAD.
2001-09-03: SQLCMD: *INTERFACE CHANGE* Rename -h (history) option to -y.
            The new -h option is for help, and shows the program version
            information, the summary usage, and a succinct description of
            each option.  Reserve option flags for integrating SQLUPLOAD
            into SQLCMD; there will be changes compared with SQLUPLOAD as
            a free-standing program.
2001-09-02: SQLCMD: Add INFO CHECK CONSTRAINTS.
2001-09-01: SQLCMD: Upgrade INFO TABLES, INFO SYSTABLES and INFO SYNONYMS
            to include table type information.
2001-08-30: SQLCMD: Implement INFO STATUS and INFO FRAGMENTS.
2001-08-30: SQLCMD: Reject handling XML input for LOAD as too difficult to
            handle sensibly.  Generally, programs should be strict in what
            they generate as output and relaxed in what they accept as
            input.  However, amongst other things, handling XML input means
            that the code must accept <R><D1>v1a</D1><D2>v2a</D2></R> in
            one record and <R><D2>v2b</D2><D1>v1b</D1></R> in the next; the
            field names have to be accepted in any order (especially since
            they are unambiguously tagged).  The code should generate NULLs
            for any missing tags.  It must generate errors on unexpected
            tags.  The LOAD code is set up to scan rigidly formatted data.
            The new code for reading XML would need to skip attributes on
            tags, ignore embedded white space (including newlines) between
            tags, handle stuff not enclosed in the record tag, handle
            missing record tags, handle duplicate field tags, decode HTML
            escapes, and so on.  Therefore, the pseudo-XML generated by
            SQLCMD is an output-only option.  Someone can write some input
            transforming program to deal with converting from XML data to
            Informix LOAD format, possibly in Perl.  And the LOAD commands
            in SQLCMD will reject the request if the format is XML.
2001-08-29: SQLCMD: Allow for comments before built-in commands.  Also
            recognize #! as a comment so '#!/usr/bin/sqlcmd -xddbname' on
            the first line of a script works.  The (Linux 2.2.x) kernel
            executes sqlcmd with the argument -xddbname (enabling trace and
            selecting the database called dbname), followed by the script
            file name (prefixed with path), followed by any command line
            arguments.  DB-Access cannot do this because neither it nor the
            database server recognizes the #! line as a comment.
2001-08-26: SQLCMD: Remove sqlcfg.h (replaced by estrdup.c and emalloc.h).
2001-08-25: UNLOAD FORMAT: revise document to account for DB-Access -X
            option and empty, non-null VARCHAR values.
2001-08-25: SQLCMD: Remove support for blobinfile command and -b option
            prior to introducing extended versions of the LOAD, RELOAD,
            UNLOAD (and UPLOAD) statements to SQLCMD.
2001-08-24: SQLCMD: Upgrade INFO to allow WHERE clauses on general queries
            (rather than table-specific queries): INFO TABLES, SYNONYMS,
            ROLES, USERS, PROCEDURES, VIEWS, BASETABLES, SYSTABLES.  Report
            on SQL executed for INFO statements when tracing is on.
2001-08-23: SQLCMD: Do not log history to readline history until command
            expansion complete.  Support PASSWORD as equivalent of USING in
            CONNECT.  Allow EXECUTE FUNCTION as well as EXECUTE PROCEDURE
            in UNLOAD.

Version 65
----------
2001-07-13: Version 65 given limited release.
2001-07-13: SQLCMD: Attempt to fix problems with 64-bit integers, reported
            by Paul Falbe <paul@cassens.com>.  Solution requires ESQL/C
            analogues of PRId_int etc found in C99 header <inttypes.h>, not
            provided by Informix.  Have not addressed warnings or build
            issues requiring extra options on HP-UX 11.00.
2001-07-12: SQLCMD: Recognize end of procedure when procedure contains
            BEGIN <block> END END PROCEDURE; problem found by Mahesh
            Chandrasekhar <Mahesh.Chandrasekhar@sciatl.com>
2001-04-06: BUILD: Clean up stray generated files.
2001-04-05: SQLCMD: Add verbose command (option -v) to print information

----------
2001-04-04: Version 64 released (sent to IIUG web site).
2001-04-03: SQLCMD: Add ibase (option -a) to specify input base, so you can
            load integer data with leading zeroes.  Problem first spotted
            in 1993 (noted when digging through ancient notebook), but also
            independently noted in 2001.

Version 63
----------
2001-03-30: Version 63 released.
2001-03-29: SQLCMD: Use _XOPEN_SOURCE 500 to declare strdup() in context.c.
            Reorder headers in sqlver.c and readcmd.c to avoid conflicts
            between ESQL/C 9.16 headers and stderr.h (error and version).

Version 62
----------
2001-03-05: Version 62 released (sent to IIUG web site).
2001-03-02: SQLCMD: record comments correctly.  NB: # is no longer treated as a
            comment introducer because IUS provides statement local variables
            (SLVs or OUT parameters), and these use the # symbol to separate
            the argument name and the type.
2001-01-28: SQLCMD: use fixed ESQL/C headers for 7.2x.

Version 61
----------
2001-01-19: Version 61 released (sent to IIUG web site).
2001-01-18: BUILD: Known not to build with Bison 1.14; should be OK with 1.16.

2001-01-15: SQLCMD: attempt to fix yydebug support for plain yacc.
2001-01-15: BUILD: use -lcurses or -lncurses (but not without -lreadline).

Version 59
----------
2001-01-11: Version 59 released (sent to IIUG web site).
2001-01-10: BUILD: patch ESQL/C 5.x scripts to recognize $INFORMIXC.
2001-01-10: SQLCMD: initialize XML handling correctly.
2001-01-09: SQLCMD: handle IIF.2000 SET{...} notation, but not as a
            comment.  Record comments in history as well as SQL.

Version 58
----------
2001-01-08: Version 58 released.
2001-01-07: BUILD: retain CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS set during configure.

2000-07-11: SQLCMD: unfreeze the version number.
2000-07-10: SQLCMD: make it compile under G++.
2000-07-09: SQLCMD: readline code does not handle everything that it
            should.  It echoes prompts when reading from file; it echoes
            what it reads from the file.  It doesn't like blank lines.  It
            records empty lines in history.  It isn't happy if you try to
            go backwards in history before the first command entered.  In
            short, it is a minor disaster.  It also re-emphasizes the need
            for a sound test suite, which is sadly lacking.

Version 56
----------
2000-06-16: Version 56 released (sent to IIUG web site).
2000-06-16: SQLCMD: Add INFO ACCESS.
2000-06-15: LIBRARY: Replace sqltabid.ec, sqlprocid.ec, sqltrigid.ec by

            TRIGGERS and TRIGBODY.  Use upgraded library to handle
            delimited identifiers (requires connection logging, but this
            code is incomplete for DATABASE statements and '-d' option).
2000-06-11: SQLCMD: use GNU readline when available.  Work largely done by
            Benjamin Kahn <xkahn@cybersites.com>  -- Thank You!
2000-05-25: SQLCMD: Add INFO VIEWBODY.

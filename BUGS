KNOWN BUGS IN SQLCMD Version 90.02 (2016-07-28)

Regrettably, there are some bugs in the SQLCMD suite which have not been
fully resolved.  These problems should not affect the majority of users,
but they are are bound to affect some people (if only those who report
the bugs in the first place).

SQLCMD

2008-07-13:
    If you make a syntax error in the part of a LOAD statement after the
    keyword INSERT, then you get a message which identifies the correct
    file, but suggests the line number is 1.  If you make the mistake
    earlier, you typically get a line number that's one too large, so an
    error on line 3 of a file is reported at line 4.  Neither is ideal;
    neither is catastrophic.

    DB-Access formats money using locale information - SQLCMD does not.

SQLUPLOAD

2005-01-13:
    There's a problem with managing updates where part of the 'key' data
    is null.  The code was supposed to manage this, but somewhere along
    the line, the sqlda structure is getting recreated and losing the
    null-ness information.
